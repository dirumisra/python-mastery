    "### Explanation:\n",
    "- **Mixin**: A class that provides a small, reusable piece of functionality, often used via multiple inheritance to add features like logging, authentication, or serialization to other classes.\n",
    "- **MRO (Method Resolution Order)**: Determines the order in which methods are looked up in the inheritance chain. This helps avoid ambiguity when multiple base classes define the same method.\n",
    "- **Diamond Problem**: Occurs when a class inherits from two classes that share a common ancestor. This ambiguity is resolved automatically by Python’s MRO mechanism.\n",
    "- **Abstract Class**: A class that serves as a blueprint for other classes, defining abstract methods that must be implemented in child classes. It cannot be instantiated directly.\n",
    "- **Cooperative Inheritance**: Ensures that the `super()` function is called properly in classes that use multiple inheritance, allowing methods to be called in the correct order across class hierarchies.\n"
